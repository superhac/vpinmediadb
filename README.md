Special thanks to @jsm174 for making dream of running VPX on Linux a reality.  

A big thank you to all the hard work and dedication the [VPS Team](https://virtualpinballspreadsheet.github.io) team (@Dux, @Fraesh and @Studlygoorite) has put into creating this great table finding resource!  And they made it "open" so others can leverage it as they want.
